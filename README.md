# forecasting_principles_practice_python_code

This repo is a translation of all of the code snippets and examples, but not the exercises, from the book Forecasting: Principles and practice by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos.  The book can be found [here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/).  Ongoing project, will update with more notebooks as I complete them.  

All of the datasets from the R package fpp3 can be found in the data folder.
